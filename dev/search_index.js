Global parameterizations of e.g. SO(3) are needed to avoid singularities, but this leads to the problem that the tangent space no longer has the same dimension as the ambient space of the global parameterization. A Munthe-Kaas integrator solves this problem by converting back and forth between local and global coordinates at every integration time step.\n\nThe idea is to do the dynamics and compute the stages of the integration scheme in terms of local coordinates centered around the global parameterization of the configuration at the end of the previous time step (e.g. exponential coordinates), combine the stages into a new set of local coordinates as usual for Runge-Kutta methods, and then convert the local coordinates back to global coordinates.\n\nFrom Iserles et al., 'Lie-group methods' (2000).\n\nAnother useful reference is Park and Chung, 'Geometric Integration on Euclidean Group with Application to Articulated Multibody Systems' (2005).\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"simulation/#RigidBodyDynamics.OdeIntegrators.MuntheKaasIntegrator-Union{Tuple{L}, Tuple{X}, Tuple{S}, Tuple{F}, Tuple{T}, Tuple{N}, Tuple{X,F,ButcherTableau{N,T,L},S}} where L where X where S<:OdeResultsSink where F where T where N","page":"Simulation","title":"RigidBodyDynamics.OdeIntegrators.MuntheKaasIntegrator","text":"MuntheKaasIntegrator(state, dynamics!, tableau, sink)\n\n\nCreate a MuntheKaasIntegrator given:\n\na callable dynamics!(vd, t, state) that updates the joint acceleration vector vd at time t and in state state;\na ButcherTableau tableau, specifying the integrator coefficients;\nan OdeResultsSink sink which processes the results of the integration procedure at each time step.\n\nstate must be of a type for which the following functions are defined:\n\nconfiguration(state), returns the configuration vector in global coordinates;\nvelocity(state), returns the velocity vector;\nadditional_state(state), returns the vector of additional states;\nset_velocity!(state, v), sets velocity vector to v;\nset_additional_state!(state, s), sets vector of additional states to s;\nglobal_coordinates!(state, q0, Ï•), sets global coordinates in state based on local coordinates Ï• centered around global coordinates q0;\nlocal_coordinates!(Ï•, Ï•d, state, q0), converts state's global configuration q and velocity v to local coordinates centered around global coordinates q0.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"simulation/#RigidBodyDynamics.OdeIntegrators.ButcherTableau","page":"Simulation","title":"RigidBodyDynamics.OdeIntegrators.ButcherTableau","text":"struct ButcherTableau{N, T, L}\n\nA Butcher tableau.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"simulation/#RigidBodyDynamics.OdeIntegrators.OdeResultsSink","page":"Simulation","title":"RigidBodyDynamics.OdeIntegrators.OdeResultsSink","text":"abstract type OdeResultsSink\n\nDoes 'something' with the results of an ODE integration (e.g. storing results, visualizing, etc.).
